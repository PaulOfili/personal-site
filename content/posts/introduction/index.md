Hey guys, so I decided to start a blog where I write about my new learnings and experiences. I also plan to give real time updates of the projects I will be working on. They will mainly feature System Design and Full Stack applications. I will be describing the software development life cycle, from the project idea creation, to its set up, development, execution, testing and finally to the deployment phase.

This means I would need to learn new technologies to support the development stage as well as the Continuous Integration and Delivery/Deployment pipeline which should be fun. I am looking forward to working with these technologies hands on. These includes but not limited to Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Terraform, Cloud Providers like AWS or GCP.

The first project idea I would be working on is a Remote Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game that has an AI mode. This means you could play with friends anywhere in the world or you could play against the company which never loses and could easily beat you if you do not bring your A-game. The remote multiplayer feature will be handled with WebSockets, the front-end of the application would be built with React while the back-end with Node. Redis, an in-memory would be used to store the games information.  Finally, Docker would be used to containerize it and prep it for deployment as well as easier development and integration.

So yeah, I hope you are as pumped as I am and let's begin, shall we?
