I am Full Stack Web Developer and DevOps Engineer with passion in Artificial Intelligence. My tech stack includes Python, React and React Native, Node, Java and Kafka.

I build web applications with React as the front-end and Node as the backend. All JavaScript, just the way I like it!

I actively incorporate DevOps and system architecture during the software development life cycle to help build scalable, agile and portable applications with tools such as Docker, Kubernetes and Jenkins to help in the CI/CD pipeline.

As for my professional work experience, I have worked as a software engineer with Interswitch, a fintech company in Nigeria as a Front-end engineer building solutions for effective API Management. I also interned with Goldman Sachs in the UK where I worked with the global team to automate a time-consuming task with software. You can check out [my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-yvOj4Qzb5zd_48rOQEfkkprWIWfhdbZ/view?usp=sharing) for more details. Currently, I work as a freelancer consultant and engage in personal projects.

I plan to start a series where I build popular system design projects from scratch using skills and languages afforementioned with so much more as I learn them. So stay tuned as I am going to document them here.

When not coding, I draw, work out and solve algorithms. I know, quite boring, but that is me.
