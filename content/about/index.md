I am Full Stack Web Developer and DevOps Engineer with passion in Artificial Intelligence. My tools 

I build web applications with React as the front-end and Node as the backend. All JavaScript, just the way I like it!

I dabble with DevOps and system architecture building scalable, agile and portable applications with tools such as Docker, Kubernetes and Jenkins to help in the CI/CD pipeline.

As for professional work experience, I worked as a software engineer with Interswitch, a fintech company in Nigeria, then interned with Goldman Sachs in the UK and now, I work as a freelancer consultant or you could catch me building personal projects whenever chanced. I plan to start a series where I build popular system design projects from scratch using skills and language afforementioned with so much more as I learn them. So stay tuned as I am going to document them here.

When not coding, I draw, work out and solve algorithms. I know, quite boring, but that is me.
