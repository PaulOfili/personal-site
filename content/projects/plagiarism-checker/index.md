[Plagiarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism) as defined by Wikipedia, is the representation of another author's language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions as one's own original work. In educated contexts, there are differing definitions of plagiarism depending on the institution.

Whew, almost plagiarised there for a second. But luckily, I referenced the source. So we are all good.

I was given a project idea to determine the similarity score between the student's submissions with that of the online source so as to prevent students from submitting plagiarised content. . Cool right?

Find the repository and demo links below. The demo is currently under construction.
