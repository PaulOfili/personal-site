[Plagiarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism) is the representation of another author's language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions as one's own original work. In educated contexts, there are differing definitions of plagiarism depending on the institution.

Whew, almost plagiarised there for a second. But luckily, I referenced the source. So we are all good.

So I was given a project idea to determine the similarity score between the student's submissions with that of the online source. Cool right?
